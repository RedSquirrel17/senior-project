What is your something cool?
-------
When I press the "#" key, the LCD reprints the previous input. 

Post-lab Questions
-------
1. When multiple keys are pressed, can the scan algorithm correctly detect all keys pressed? (Hint: ghosting, or ghost key)
- No. This problem cannot be solved unless we can change the hardware. The problem that occurs when multiple keys are
pressed is called "ghosting," where the key presses that don't register are "ghosted." This happens because a short is
created within the keyboard, and the program does not know which key is actually pressed. 

2. What suggestions you would give to improve the experiences of this lab?
- Perhaps if there were any possibility of more TAs in the lab at a time, because TAs are generally very busy checking people
off on the previous week's lab, it is difficult to ask questions until at least an hour of lab has gone by. 

3. For the textbook, do you find any typos or have any comments or suggestions?
- Especially for those of us who have had less experience coding, some more example code, especially in specialized sections
of the book that talk about the LCD, etc. 


Suggestions and Comments
-------
* Report the typos, errors, or suggestions into the "typos" session on piazza site (https://piazza.com/maine/spring2017/ece271/home)
* I offer one dollar each new typo or error in the latest edition (printed in May, 2016).

Lab Credits

* Did you received any help from someone other than Prof. Zhu and lab teaching assistants?
